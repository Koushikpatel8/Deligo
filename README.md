# Deligo - Django-Based Online Food Delivery Platform

## Project Overview

**Deligo** is a Django-based web application that facilitates food ordering between customers and restaurant managers. Built as part of a university coursework project, the application supports user authentication, dynamic menu displays, cart functionality, order placement, and manager order tracking â€” all integrated with a relational SQLite database.

Deligo replaces static HTML/JS with a full server-side architecture using Django, forms, models, AJAX, and database connectivity.

## Technologies Used

- Django 4.2  
- SQLite3  
- HTML + CSS (Bootstrap-like design)  
- JavaScript & AJAX  
- Django Templates + Static Files  
- VS Code (Development environment)  

---

## Features You Can Test

- Register as a new customer  
- Add multiple dishes with quantity  
- Navigate and update cart dynamically  
- Proceed to checkout via AJAX
